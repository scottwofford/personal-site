  <h2>2. Accelerate Your Learning</h2>

  <p>As you learn more, you will hypothesize about what is going on and why. Increasingly, your learning will shift toward fleshing out and testing those hypotheses.</p>

  <p><strong>Start by generating questions about the past, the present, and the future:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Questions About the Past"</li>
    <li>"Questions About the Present"</li>
    <li>"Questions About the Future"</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Questions About the Past</h3>

  <h4>Performance</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>How has this organization performed in the past? How do people in the organization think it has performed?</li>
    <li>How were goals set? Were they insufficiently or overly ambitious?</li>
    <li>Were internal or external benchmarks used?</li>
    <li>What measures were employed? What behaviors did they encourage and discourage?</li>
    <li>What happened if goals were not met?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Root Causes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>If performance has been good, why has that been the case?</li>
    <li>What have been the relative contributions of strategy, structure, systems, talent bases, culture, and politics?</li>
    <li>If performance has been poor, why has that been the case? Do the primary issues reside in the organization's strategy? Its structure? Its technical capabilities? Its culture? Its politics?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>History of Change</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>What efforts have been made to change the organization? What happened?</li>
    <li>Who has been instrumental in shaping this organization?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Questions About the Present</h3>

  <h4>Vision and Strategy</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the stated vision and strategy?</li>
    <li>Is the organization really pursuing that strategy? If not, why not? If so, will the strategy take the organization where it needs to go?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>People</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Who is capable, and who is not?</li>
    <li>Who is trustworthy, and who is not?</li>
    <li>Who has influence, and why?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Processes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the key processes?</li>
    <li>Are they performing acceptably in quality, reliability, and timeliness? If not, why not?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Land Mines</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>What lurking surprises could detonate and push you off track?</li>
    <li>What potentially damaging cultural or political missteps must you avoid?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Early Wins</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In what areas (people, relationships, processes, or products) can you achieve some early wins?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Questions About the Future</h3>

  <h4>Challenges and Opportunities</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>In what areas is the organization most likely to face stiff challenges in the coming year? What can be done now to prepare for them?</li>
    <li>What are the most promising unexploited opportunities? What would need to happen to realize their potential?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Barriers and Resources</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the most formidable barriers to making needed changes? Are they technical? Cultural? Political?</li>
    <li>Are there islands of excellence or other high-quality resources that you can leverage?</li>
    <li>What new capabilities need to be developed or acquired?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Culture</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Which elements of the culture should be preserved?</li>
    <li>Which elements need to change?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Structured Learning Methods</h2>

  <p>Many leaders tend to dive in and start talking to people. You will pick up much soft information in this way, but it is not efficient. That's because its lack of structure makes it difficult to know how much weight to place on various individuals' observations.</p>

  <p>Instead, you should consider using a <strong>structured learning process</strong>.</p>

  <h3>The Five Questions Method</h3>
  <p>When diagnosing a new organization, start by meeting with your direct reports one-on-one. Ask them essentially the same five questions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or going to face) in the near future?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>If you were me, what would you focus attention on?</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>These five questions, coupled with careful listening and thoughtful follow-up, are certain to elicit many insights. By asking everyone the same set of questions, you can identify prevalent and divergent views and thus avoid being swayed by the first or most forceful or articulate person you talk to.</p>

  <h3>Table: Structured Methods for Learning</h3>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Uses</th>
      <th>Useful for</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Organizational climate surveys</strong></td>
      <td>Learning about culture and morale. Many organizations do such surveys regularly, and a database may already be available.</td>
      <td>Useful for managers at all levels if the analysis is available specifically for your unit or group. Usefulness depends on granularity of collection and analysis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Structured sets of interviews</strong></td>
      <td>Identifying shared and divergent perceptions of opportunities and problems. Can interview people at same level in different departments (horizontal slice) or bore down through multiple levels (vertical slice).</td>
      <td>Most useful for managers leading groups of people from different functional backgrounds. Can be useful at lower levels if the unit is experiencing significant problems.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Focus groups</strong></td>
      <td>Probing issues that preoccupy key groups of employees, such as morale issues among frontline production or service workers. Fostering discussion promotes deeper insight.</td>
      <td>Most useful for managers of large groups of people who perform a similar function, such as sales managers or plant managers. Can be useful for senior managers as a way of getting quick insights into the perceptions of key employee constituencies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Analysis of critical past decisions</strong></td>
      <td>Illuminating decision-making patterns and sources of power and influence. Select an important recent decision and look into how it was made.</td>
      <td>Most useful for higher-level managers of business units or project groups.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Process analysis</strong></td>
      <td>Examining interactions among departments and functions and assessing the efficiency of a process. Select an important process, such as delivery of products to customers or distributors, and assign a cross-functional group to chart the process and identify bottlenecks and problems.</td>
      <td>Most useful for managers of units or groups in which the work of multiple functional specialties must be integrated. Can be useful for lower-level managers as a way of understanding how their groups fit into larger processes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Plant and market tours</strong></td>
      <td>Learning firsthand from people close to the product. Plant tours let you meet production personnel informally and listen to their concerns. Market tours can introduce you to customers, whose comments can reveal problems and opportunities.</td>
      <td>Most useful for managers of business units.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Pilot projects</strong></td>
      <td>Gaining deep insight into technical capabilities, culture, and politics. Although these insights are not the primary purpose of pilot projects, you can learn a lot from how the organization or group responds to your pilot initiatives.</td>
      <td>Useful for managers at all levels. The size of the pilot projects and their impact will increase as you rise through the organization.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>4. Negotiate Success</h2>

  <h3>Creating a Learning Plan</h3>
  <p>Your <strong>learning agenda</strong> defines what you want to learn. Your <strong>learning plan</strong> defines how you will go about learning it. It translates learning goals into specific sets of actions—identifying promising sources of insight and using systematic methods—that accelerate your learning.</p>

  <p>Your learning plan is a critical part of your overall 90-day plan.</p>
