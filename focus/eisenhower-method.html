  <h1>The Eisenhower Method</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Time management equals prioritization.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>The Eisenhower Matrix (also called the Urgent-Important Matrix) is a decision-making framework that helps you prioritize tasks by urgency and importance.</p>
  <h2>The Matrix</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th></th><th>Urgent</th><th>Not Urgent</th></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Important</strong></td><td>Do First</td><td>Schedule</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strong>Not Important</strong></td><td>Delegate</td><td>Eliminate</td></tr>
  </table>
  <h2>The Key Insight</h2>
  <p>The exercise isn't just about sorting tasks—it's about understanding that <strong>growing your impact over time means doing more things that are important but not urgent</strong>.</p>
  <p>Most people spend too much time in the "urgent" columns, reacting to demands rather than proactively building toward goals.</p>
  <h2>Quadrant Breakdown</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Do First (Urgent + Important):</strong> Crises, deadlines, emergencies. Handle these immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>Schedule (Not Urgent + Important):</strong> Strategic planning, relationship building, learning, prevention. This is where long-term success is built. Block time for these.</li>
    <li><strong>Delegate (Urgent + Not Important):</strong> Interruptions, some meetings, some emails. Others can often handle these.</li>
    <li><strong>Eliminate (Not Urgent + Not Important):</strong> Time wasters, busywork, some emails. Cut these ruthlessly.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Practical Application</h2>
  <p>Ask yourself regularly:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What am I doing that feels urgent but isn't actually important?</li>
    <li>What important things am I neglecting because they're not screaming at me?</li>
    <li>How can I create systems to spend more time in Quadrant 2?</li>
  </ul>
