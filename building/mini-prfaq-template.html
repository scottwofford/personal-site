  <h1>Mini-PRFAQ Template</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A lightweight document to validate an idea before committing to a full spec.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>What Is a Mini-PRFAQ?</h2>
  <p>A Mini-PRFAQ (Press Release / Frequently Asked Questions) is a 1-2 page document that forces clarity on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What problem are you solving?</li>
    <li>Who are you solving it for?</li>
    <li>Why does it matter now?</li>
    <li>What does the experience look like?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It's not just for product managers—anyone proposing an idea should be able to write one.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>When to Use It</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Early ideation</strong> - before committing engineering time</li>
    <li><strong>Quick alignment</strong> - when you need stakeholder buy-in</li>
    <li><strong>Lightweight proposals</strong> - when a full spec is overkill</li>
    <li><strong>Prioritization discussions</strong> - to compare opportunities</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Template</h2>
  <h3>1. Title</h3>
  <p><em>Clear, descriptive name for the initiative</em></p>
  <h3>2. Tagline</h3>
  <p><em>One sentence that captures the value proposition</em></p>
  <h3>3. Press Release (1 page max)</h3>
  <p>Write as if you're announcing this to customers after it launches:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> What pain point exists today?</li>
    <li><strong>Solution:</strong> What are we building?</li>
    <li><strong>Customer quote:</strong> What would a happy customer say?</li>
    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> High-level experience (include rough mocks if helpful)</li>
    <li><strong>Call to action:</strong> What do customers do next?</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>4. FAQs</h3>
  <p><strong>FAQ 1: What customer problem are you solving?</strong><br><em>Be specific about customer segments</em></p>
  <p><strong>FAQ 2: Why is it important to solve this now?</strong><br><em>What's the cost of waiting? What tailwinds exist?</em></p>
  <p><strong>FAQ 3: What is the customer experience?</strong><br><em>Walk through the journey; include mocks if possible</em></p>
  <p><strong>FAQ 4: Are other teams working on this?</strong><br><em>Related efforts, potential overlap, dependencies</em></p>
  <p><strong>FAQ 5: How will we know we're successful?</strong><br><em>Key metrics and success criteria</em></p>
  <hr>
  <h2>What Makes a Good Mini-PRFAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Starts with the customer</strong> - not the technology or the business goal</li>
    <li><strong>Clear problem statement</strong> - a real pain point, not a solution looking for a problem</li>
    <li><strong>Concrete experience</strong> - you can picture what the customer does</li>
    <li><strong>Honest about unknowns</strong> - what you know vs. what you're assuming</li>
    <li><strong>Short</strong> - if you can't explain it in 1-2 pages, you don't understand it yet</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>What It's NOT</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A technical spec</li>
    <li>A project plan</li>
    <li>A commitment to build</li>
    <li>A substitute for customer research</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Next Steps After a Mini-PRFAQ</h2>
  <p>If the idea has legs:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Validate assumptions with customer research</li>
    <li>Size the opportunity (rough order of magnitude)</li>
    <li>Identify key risks and unknowns</li>
    <li>Decide: full PRFAQ, prototype, or kill</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <p><em>The goal is clarity and alignment, not documentation. Keep it short.</em></p>
