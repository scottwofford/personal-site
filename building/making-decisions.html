  <h1>Making Decisions</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A framework for navigating complex trade-offs and escalations.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>When You Need This</h2>
  <p>Use this framework when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A decision is a <strong>one-way door</strong> (hard to reverse)</li>
    <li>Two teams disagree and need resolution</li>
    <li>The trade-offs are complex and contested</li>
    <li>You need leadership input to move forward</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you can easily reverse the decision later, just pick one and move. This framework is for the hard calls.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>The Core Structure</h2>
  <p>Distill the debate to a single statement, options, and pros/cons:</p>
  <pre>We are debating whether to do X, Y, or Z.

Option A (Recommended by [Person/Team]):
[Brief description]
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

Option B (Recommended by [Person/Team]):
[Brief description]
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...

Option C (Not recommended):
[Brief description]
- Pros: ...
- Cons: ...</pre>
  <hr>
  <h2>Template</h2>
  <h3>Decision: [One-sentence framing of the choice]</h3>
  <p><strong>Context:</strong> Why is this decision needed now? What's the cost of delay?</p>
  <p><strong>One-way door?</strong> Yes/No — Can we reverse this easily if we're wrong?</p>
  <p><strong>Options:</strong></p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th><th>Recommended by</th></tr>
    <tr><td>A</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>B</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>C</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  </table>
  <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> [Your recommendation and why]</p>
  <p><strong>What we need:</strong> [Decision? Input? Escalation path?]</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Principles</h2>
  <h3>Represent all positions fairly</h3>
  <p>If two parties disagree, present both positions in the best possible light. This builds trust and often reveals the real crux of disagreement.</p>
  <h3>Lead with data</h3>
  <p>The debate should be grounded in evidence, not opinions. What data supports each option? What's missing?</p>
  <h3>Razor the debate</h3>
  <p>Simplifying the decision and its data-driven factors often illuminates the answer without escalation at all. If you can't state the trade-off simply, you don't understand it yet.</p>
  <h3>Explain why it's hard</h3>
  <p>If the decision were obvious, you wouldn't need this framework. Make explicit why reasonable people disagree.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Anti-Patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Straw-manning</strong> — presenting the other side weakly to make your recommendation look better</li>
    <li><strong>Kitchen sink</strong> — listing 7 options when there are really 2-3 viable ones</li>
    <li><strong>Hidden recommendation</strong> — burying your actual opinion; just state it clearly</li>
    <li><strong>Escalating too early</strong> — use this framework to clarify your own thinking first; sometimes that resolves it</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>One-Way vs. Two-Way Doors</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th>One-Way Door</th><th>Two-Way Door</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Hard or expensive to reverse</td><td>Easy to reverse</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Requires careful analysis</td><td>Bias toward action</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Get more input</td><td>Decide and iterate</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Examples: architecture choices, public commitments, team restructures</td><td>Examples: UI copy, feature flags, most experiments</td></tr>
  </table>
  <p>For two-way doors, don't over-invest in decision frameworks. Just try something.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><em>The goal isn't to avoid decisions—it's to make them well when they matter, and make them fast when they don't.</em></p>
