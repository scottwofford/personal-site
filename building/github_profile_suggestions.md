# GitHub Profile Optimization for Scott Wofford

## Key Insight: PM/Founder GitHub Profiles That Work

Based on research of successful PM/founder profiles (Harrison Chase, Guillermo Rauch, Yohei Nakajima), the pattern is clear: **show strategic technical engagement, not deep coding volume**.

---

## Recommended Bio

**Current:** (likely minimal)

**Suggested:**
```
Co-founder @luthien-research | AI Safety | Ex-Amazon Principal PM (9 yrs)
📍 Seattle | 🌴 Colombia/Mexico winters
Building tools for AI alignment verification
```

**Why:** Concise, shows credibility (Amazon tenure), current focus, personality (location flexibility). Emoji use is restrained but adds approachability.

## 6 Pinned Repos Strategy

You probably don't have tons of personal repos (most PMs don't). Here's how to build a strong set:

### Immediate Pins (if available)
1. **Luthien org repo** - Pin your company's public-facing work
2. **Any Claude/AI safety tooling** - Even small utilities show engagement

### Create These (low-effort, high-signal)
3. **awesome-ai-safety** - Curated list of AI safety resources, papers, tools
4. **pm-ai-workflows** - Your personal AI-assisted PM workflows (Claude prompts, automation scripts)
5. **luthien-public** - Company documentation, research summaries, or a landing page

### Fork + Customize
6. **Fork a relevant AI safety tool** and add value (documentation, use case examples)

## Activity Strategy (Without Heavy Coding)

You don't need to code constantly. What matters:

1. **Star strategically** - Star AI safety repos, tools you use, projects from Seldon network
2. **Follow the right people** - Buck Shlegeris, Anthropic team, FAR.AI folks, your Seldon cohort
3. **Open issues** - File thoughtful issues on AI tools you use
4. **Review PRs** - If Luthien has public repos, show code review activity
5. **Update READMEs** - Documentation contributions count

## Exemplary Profiles to Study

| Profile | Why It Works | Steal This |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| [@hwchase17](https://github.com/hwchase17) (LangChain) | Product repos + educational examples | Mix of serious + template repos |
| [@rauchg](https://github.com/rauchg) (Vercel) | Personality projects + current work | wifi-password style fun project |
| [@yoheinakajima](https://github.com/yoheinakajima) | Authentic bio + high-impact pins | "I don't know what I'm doing here" energy |
| [@gvanrossum](https://github.com/gvanrossum) | Minimal but authoritative | Direct bio, current work focus |

---

## Quick Wins (Do This Week)

1. ✅ Update bio with company affiliation + location
2. ✅ Add profile photo if missing
3. ✅ Pin any existing relevant repos
4. ✅ Star 10-15 AI safety repos
5. ✅ Follow your Seldon cohort members on GitHub
6. ⏳ Create one "awesome" list or workflow repo

---

## What NOT To Do

- ❌ Don't apologize for not being a "real developer"
- ❌ Don't leave it empty - an empty profile signals disengagement
- ❌ Don't pin tutorial repos or incomplete projects
- ❌ Don't fake activity with meaningless commits

---

## Bottom Line

Your GitHub should say: "I understand the technical landscape, I'm actively engaged in AI safety, and I build/lead things that ship."

The bar for PM/founder profiles is **lower than you think** — most aren't engineers. The ones that stand out show strategic engagement, not code volume.
