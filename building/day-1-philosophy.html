  <h1>Day 1 Mentality</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Staying scrappy as you scale.</p>

  <h2>What Is Day 1?</h2>
  <p>Jeff Bezos has included his <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders">1997 letter to shareholders</a> with every subsequent annual letter. The core message: it's still Day 1.</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1."
    <p class="quote-attr">— Jeff Bezos, 2017 All Hands</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Day 1 is a mindset: start-up energy, customer obsession, fast decisions, willingness to experiment. Day 2 is what happens when you lose that—process becomes the point, decisions slow down, you optimize for the organization instead of the customer.</p>

  <h2>The Four Elements of Day 1 Defense</h2>
  <p>From Bezos's <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders">2016 letter to shareholders</a>:</p>

  <h3>1. True Customer Obsession</h3>
  <blockquote>"Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight."</blockquote>
  <p>Start with the customer and work backwards. Not competitors. Not internal stakeholders. The customer.</p>

  <h3>2. Resist Proxies</h3>
  <blockquote>"Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you're not watchful, the process can become the thing."</blockquote>
  <p>Metrics, processes, and rituals can become proxies for the outcomes you actually care about. When someone says "we followed the process," ask: did we get the right outcome?</p>

  <h3>3. Embrace External Trends</h3>
  <blockquote>"If you fight them, you're probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind."</blockquote>
  <p>The world changes. Companies that resist obvious trends (mobile, cloud, AI) get disrupted by those that embrace them.</p>

  <h3>4. High-Velocity Decision Making</h3>
  <blockquote>"Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you're probably being slow."</blockquote>
  <p>Speed matters. Many decisions are reversible (two-way doors). Don't apply heavyweight processes to lightweight decisions.</p>

  <h2>Signals You're Drifting to Day 2</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No one owns the customer experience end-to-end</li>
    <li>Decisions require many approvals</li>
    <li>"That's just how we do it here"</li>
    <li>Metrics become goals instead of indicators</li>
    <li>New hires say things move slowly</li>
    <li>Innovation happens at the edges, not the core</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Applying This Outside Big Companies</h2>
  <p>The Day 1 mindset isn't just for large organizations. It's a useful check for any team or project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Are we focused on the customer or on ourselves?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Are we moving fast or waiting for perfect information?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Are our processes helping or becoming the point?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Are we embracing new tools and trends or clinging to old ones?</strong></li>
  </ul>
