  <h1>Writing Guide</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">A framework for producing drafts quickly without getting stuck.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Core Principle: The Reaction Draft</h2>

  <p>The goal is to produce something a collaborator can react to in 10 minutes, not a polished final draft. Gaps marked as <code>[GAP: need X]</code> or <code>[INCOMPLETE: X]</code> are fine.</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Rough draft beats no draft. Ship at timebox, incomplete is OK.</p>

  <h2>Writing Workflow</h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Big Picture First</h3>
  <p>Before writing anything, establish:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Who is reading this? What's their background?</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> What do I want them to do/believe after reading?</li>
    <li><strong>Shared beliefs:</strong> Don't waste words convincing on these</li>
    <li><strong>Key points to emphasize:</strong> What's novel or differentiating?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 2: Pyramid Principle Structure</h3>
  <p>Especially for introductions. Establish shared understanding, then pivot to your contribution.</p>
  <p><strong>Pattern:</strong> Context (what exists) → Gap (what's missing) → Question → Your contribution</p>

  <h3>Step 3: Establish Outline</h3>
  <p>Before drafting sections, write section anchors: "This section shows [X] by [evidence]."</p>
  <p>The outline should make the pyramid logic and story flow clear to the reader. If you can't anchor a section in 2 min, skip and return later.</p>

  <h3>Step 4: Sentence by Sentence</h3>
  <p>Don't write whole paragraphs or sections at once. That's a failure mode that causes cognitive overload.</p>
  <p>Mark gaps explicitly: <code>[GAP: need X]</code> or <code>[INCOMPLETE: X]</code></p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Time Management</h2>

  <p>Set a timebox before you start. Monitor time vs. progress and give yourself one of three nudges:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>"Good enough, move on"</strong> if section meets the bar for a reaction draft</li>
    <li><strong>"Keep working"</strong> if it's not yet up to standard and there's time</li>
    <li><strong>"Mark incomplete and move on"</strong> if hitting diminishing returns. Add <code>[INCOMPLETE: X]</code> and proceed</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you're polishing past the timebox, stop. Ship what you have.</p>

  <h2>Red Flags</h2>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>If you notice...</th>
      <th>Do this...</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Researching instead of writing</td>
      <td>Just try a sentence first. Research after if it doesn't work.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Adding scope beyond the section anchor</td>
      <td>Ask: does it fit this section's anchor?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Polishing the same sentence repeatedly</td>
      <td>Good enough for reaction draft. Move on.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Comparing multiple drafts/voices</td>
      <td>Pick one and commit. Collaborator can redirect if needed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Stuck inventing a narrative</td>
      <td>What do you actually know? What's assumption?</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Quality Checklist</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Direct claims, then evidence:</strong> State the point first, support with specifics</li>
    <li><strong>Technical precision:</strong> Use exact terms, not vague language</li>
    <li><strong>Acknowledge uncertainty:</strong> "I think," "I believe," "this is provisional"</li>
    <li><strong>Concrete examples:</strong> Reference specific incidents, not generic claims</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Things to Avoid</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Generic language without specifics</li>
    <li>Overpromising or hype</li>
    <li>Burying the point in qualifications</li>
    <li>Sounding like marketing copy</li>
    <li>Unnecessary hedging that weakens claims</li>
    <li>Obvious statements the reader already knows</li>
  </ul>
