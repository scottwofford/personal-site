# Current Objective: Dropbox Content Audit for scottwofford.com

Audit Dropbox files for content worth publishing on personal site. Inspired by [sigilwen.ca](https://sigilwen.ca/) — reading logs, essays, reflective writing.

## Context

- Dropbox Smart Sync was keeping files as online-only placeholders (0 bytes locally)
- Built a hydration script to force-download all content via Quick Look
- Once hydrated, scan for publishable content (book notes, essays, quotes, reflections)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All Dropbox files hydrated (downloaded locally)
- [ ] Content audit complete — categorized as publish / skip / redact-needed
- [ ] Shortlist of ~10-20 pieces worth publishing on scottwofford.com
- [ ] Draft plan for how to present content (reading log? essays section? blog posts?)
