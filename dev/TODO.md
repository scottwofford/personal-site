# TODO

## High Priority

- [ ] **Recreate Been app account** - Traveling link needs destination

## Nice to Have

- [ ] **Spotify "Now Playing" widget** - Show current/last played track
- [ ] **Add favicon**

## Future Pages

- [ ] **Workflow page** (branch: `workflow`, under Productivity nav) - How I prioritize and manage multitasking with multiple AI agent instances while maintaining flow state. Capture the meta-skill of orchestrating Claude Code, Codex, etc.
  - Compare/contrast with https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/
  - What's similar, what's different, what I've learned
